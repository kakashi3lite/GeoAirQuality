# GeoAirQuality - Environmental Data Engineering Platform

## Project Overview
A scalable, edge-optimized air quality monitoring and prediction platform built with modern data engineering practices.

## Architecture

### Folder Structure
- `/data-pipeline/` - Dask-GeoPandas based data ingestion and processing pipelines
- `/api/` - FastAPI-based REST API with Redis caching and PostGIS integration
- `/edge-nodes/` - NVIDIA Jetson containerized preprocessing modules
- `/docs/` - Comprehensive documentation and architectural diagrams
- `/monitoring/` - Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards
- `/k8s/` - Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- `/web/` - WebXR AR overlay prototypes
- `/tests/` - End-to-end testing suites

## Key Features
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-50ms latency for air quality queries
- **Edge Computing**: Distributed sensor preprocessing on Jetson modules
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving ML model training across edge nodes
- **AR Visualization**: WebXR-based immersive air quality overlays
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA with custom metrics
- **Observability**: Full Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack

## Getting Started
See individual folder READMEs for detailed setup instructions.
